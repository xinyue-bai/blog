## 1. Background Information
For this visualisation makeover, I have used data from [**Imperial College London YouGov Covid 19 Behaviour Tracker Data Hub**](https://github.com/YouGov-Data/covid-19-tracker). This data gathers global insights on people’s behaviours in response to COVID-19 covering 29 countries, in the form of survey questionnaire. 
In particular, this post is interested in exploring the willingness of the public on COVID-vaccination. In this blog, I will makeover visualisation on vaccine willingness done by one of the research scientists, by examining the following 3 survey questions in the context of different gender and employment status: \
  1.  If a Covid-19 vaccine were made available to me this week, I would definitely get it. \
  2.  I am worried about getting COVID19. \
  3.  I am worried about potential side effects of a COVID19 vaccine. \

## 2. Critiques and Suggestions
```{r critiques, echo=FALSE, out.width="150%", fig.cap="original visualisation"}

### 2.1 Clarity
```{r clarity, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
SN <- 1:6 #c(" 1.", " 2.", " 3.", " 4.", " 5.", "6.")
Critique <-c("Visualisation on the left is intended to show “which country is more pro-vaccine”, by computing the percentage of each response and combining them into a percentage stacked bar chart. However, for each country, it’s not easy to see the proportion of pro-vaccine and compare it among different countries.",
             "Moreover, scaling each bar into the same height is not clear enough to compare the difference between pro-vaccine responses and anti-vaccine responses.",
             "It’s hard to distinguish bars having the same length.",
             "Legend is not very clear, i.e. what does 2, 3, 4 represent specifically?",
             "Visualisation on the right is generally straightforward and clear. However, the simple percentage does not reflect statistical measures, how much you can expect your service results to reflect the view from the overall population. For example, if we have a high proportion of strongly agree responses with a wide margin of error, then this survey result is not very reliable.",
             "Moreover, this visualisation is not convincing enough in a way that only high level view of the survey results is presented and insights from different angles are not revealed. For example, by examining deeper into gender level, males are generally more willing to get vaccinated than females respondents.")
Suggestion <-c("Sort countries by proportion of pro-vaccine responses in descending order.", 
               "Place neutral responses at centre 0, negative value showing proportion of disagree responses and positive value showing proportion of agree responses.",
               "Add value label on each bar.",
               "Change 2, 3, 4 to 2 – Agree, 3 – I don’t know, 4 – Disagree respectively.",
               "Calculate confidence interval for each value to get a more comprehensive view of the survey results.",
               "Explore survey results from various perspectives, such as gender and employment status, and the relation between other survey questions.")
clarity <- data.frame(SN, Critique, Suggestion)
kable(clarity,type='html', align='l') %>%
  row_spec(0, color = 'white', background = 'black', align='l') %>%
  column_spec(1, width='3em') %>%
  column_spec(2, width_min='30em') %>%
  column_spec(3, width_min='20em') %>%
  row_spec(1:6, extra_css = "border-bottom: 1.5px solid")

```

### 2.2 Aesthetics
```{r aesthetic, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
SN <- 1:3
Critique <-c("It’s redundant and distractive to use five different colours for each response in the left visualisation, making it hard to view the survey results. | Use the same colour for the same group (1.agree 2.neutral 3. disagree) with different hue level. For example, dark green for strongly agree, light green for agree.",
             "The x-axis of two visualisations are not consistent, the first plot has no decimal place whereas the second plot has 2 decimal places.",
             "Generally good axis marks in twenties and grid lines to facilitate easy readings, clear use of fonts, font sizes and layout with very straightforward titles.")
Suggestion <-c("Use the same colour for the same group (1.agree 2.neutral 3. disagree) with different hue level. For example, dark green for strongly agree, light green for agree.", 
               "Make them consistent.",
               "Follow and format to ensure so.")
aesthetic <- data.frame(SN, Critique, Suggestion)
kable(aesthetic,type='html', align='l') %>%
  row_spec(0, color = 'white', background = 'black', align='l') %>%
  column_spec(1, width='3em') %>%
  column_spec(2, width_min='30em') %>%
  column_spec(3, width_min='20em') %>%
  row_spec(1:3, extra_css = "border-bottom: 1.5px solid")

```

## 3. Proposed Design
### 3.1 Sketch
![Figure 2: sketch of proposed design](propose.jpeg)

### 3.2 Advantages of Proposed Design
**The first visualisation:** \
1. Clearly show which country is more pro-vaccine, by sorting rows according to % of pro-vaccine. \
2. Easier to detect difference between two types of responses and difference between countries, with postive and negative x-axis representing pro-vaccine and anti-vaccine responses respectively. \

**The second visualisation:** \
- Clearly show how reliable the result is, by applying confidence interval. \

**The third visualisation:** \
- Help audiences better understand the public willingness on Covid-19 vaccination and the potential reasons why the public agrees or disagrees to getting vaccinated, by looking into the result of survey's questions **vac2.1(worry about getting COVID)** and **vac2.2(worry about potential side effect of vaccine)**, and plotting their relation wtih trend lines. \

**Other comments:** \
- By applying tooltip, the fourth and fifth visualisation provide audiences with a more comprehensive understanding of the survey results on vaccine willingness at the country level. Similarly, being able to filter via **gender** and **employment** status gives insights on the different behaviours within each group. \

## 4. Data Visualisation Step-by-Step
### 4.1 Data Preparation
1. Import australia.csv, canada.csv, denmark.csv, finland.csv, france.csv, germany.csv, italy.csv, japan.csv, netherlands.csv, norway.csv, singapore.csv, south-korea.csv, sweden.csv, united-kingdom.csv files into tableau. \ 
2. Double click on New Union at the bottom left of Files and drag all csv files into Specific. 
![Figure 3: union imported files](new union.png)
3. Click on the triangle button on the top right and custom split variable vac_1 to obtain the score value for each response category (e.g. 1 - Strongly agree -> 1).
![Figure 4: select custom split](custom split 1.png)
![Figure 5: custom split](custom split 2.png)
4. Edit aliases for new column created (i.e. vac_1 - Split 1), 1 -> **1 - Strongly**, 2 -> **2 - Agree**, 3 -> **3 - I don't know**, 4 -> **4 - Disagree**, 5 -> **5 - Strongly disagree**.
![Figure 6: custom split](custom split 3.png)
![Figure 7: edit aliases before](edit aliases before.png)
![Figure 8: edit aliases after](edit aliases after.png)
5. Rename new column as **vac1_score**.
6. Click on **"=Abc"** symbol and change its data type to **Number(whole)**.
![Figure 10: change column's data type](change data type.png)
7. Rename **Table Name** as **Country**.

### 4.2 Creating Visualisation
### 4.2.1 Visualisation 1
1. Open a new worksheet. \
2. Click on **Analysis** -> **Create Calculated Field**. \
![Figure 12: create a calculated field](create calculated field.png)
3. Create 7 calculated fields as follow: \
    -  **Number of Records - Vac1** \
    ![Figure 13: calculate number of records that are not null](Number of Records - Vac1.png)
    -  **Total Records - Vac1** \
    ![Figure 14: calculate total records](Total Records - Vac1.png)
    -  **Count Negative** \
    ![Figure 15: Count Negative](Count Negative.png)
    -  **Total Count Negative** \
    ![Figure 16: calculate total count negative](Total Count Negative.png)
    -  **Percentage - Vac1** \
    ![Figure 17: calculate percentage of records](Percentage - Vac1.png)
    -  **Gantt Start** \
    ![Figure 18: Gantt Start](Gantt Start.png)
    -  **Gantt Percentage** \
    ![Figure 19: Gantt Percentage](Gantt Percentage.png)
    
4. Drag **Country** to **Rows**, **Grantt Percentage** to **Columns**, **vac1_score** to **Detail** and **Color** \

5. Gantt Percentage, click on the triangle button -> Compute Using -> **vac1_score**\
![Figure 21: change gantt percentage's compute using](Compute using score.png)
6. On the legend panel, right click on **Null**, **exclude** null records.\
![Figure 22: exclude null](exclude null.png)
7. On the Marks panel, right click on the triangle button of **vac1_score** (either color or detail), manually sort the vac1_score, in a order of strongly disagree -> disagree -> I don't know -> agree -> strongly agree.\
-  ![Figure 23: sort part 1](sort 1.png){width=50%} \
-  ![Figure 24: sort part 2](sort 2.png){width=50%} \
-  Before sort: ![Figure 25: before sort](before sort.png){width=50%} \
-  After sort: ![Figure 26: after sort](after sort.png){width=50%} \
8. Change chart type from Automatic to **Gantt Bar** \
![Figure 28: change to gantt bar](change to gantt bar.png)
9. Drag **Percentage - Vac1** to **Size** and **Label**.\
10. Adjust label's alignment. \
![Figure 30: adjust label alignment](adjust label alignment.png)

-  Add tick marks: ![Figure 35: change axis's value format to percentage part 3](axis format 3.png)
13. Change **color** of the gantt bar. What it displays here is already the color I wanted. Red color represents anti-vaccine responses and green color represents pro-vaccine responses. Also, darker color implies more extreme responses (e.g. strongly agree and strongly disagree).\
![Figure 36: change color of gantt bar](change color.png){width=90%}
14. **Sort** Country by % of pro-vaccine responses.\
![Figure 37: sort gantt bar](sort gantt bar.png){width=110%}

    ![Figure 54: Prop_Lower Limit 95%](Prop_Lower Limit 95%.png) \
    ![Figure 55: Prop_Upper Limit 95%](Prop_Upper Limit 95%.png)
    -  **Prop_Confidence Interval 99%** \
    ![Figure 56: Prop_Lower Limit 99%](Prop_Lower Limit 99%.png) \

## 5. Major Observations
![Figure 123: ob 1](ob 1.png) \
![Figure 124: ob 2](ob 2.png)
![Figure 124: ob 7](ob 7.png)
1. UK respondents showed the highest willingess to get vaccinated, regardless of female or male. This is consistent with the result of question Vac2.2 with respect to potential side effect. As shown in the relationship chart, UK respondents are also least worried about the side effect of COVID vaccine. \
2. Males are generally more pro-vaccine than Females.\
\
![Figure 125: ob 3](ob 3.png) 
3. Japan's result is very interesting. Japanese respondents show low willingess in getting vaccine overall, but they also express the highest worries of getting COVID compared to other countries. 38% of Japanese respondents worry about getting COVID whereas less than 38%, 35% of respondents worry about the potential side effects of COVID vaccine, implying getting COVID is more of their concern. \
\
![Figure 126: ob 4](ob 4.png)
4. The survey results is overall reliable, with a narrow confidence interval for all countries. Netherlands has a relatively larger CI range, but it's acceptable. \

```{r ob, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("ob - K.png")
knitr::include_graphics("ob - J.png")
knitr::include_graphics("ob - S.png")
```

5. By looking into the results of more developed economies in Asia, Japan, Singapore and South korea, we can see that full-time employed respondents are more willing to get vaccination in all three countries, compared to other employment status. \
\
![Figure 130: ob - F](ob - F.png){witdth=30%} \
6. French respondents show the least interest in getting vaccinated, which could possibly be explained by the fear of potential side effect of COVID vaccine as almost half of respondents(44%) strongly worry about the side effect.
