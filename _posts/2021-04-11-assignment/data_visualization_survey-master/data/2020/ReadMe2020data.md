# About the data

The Annual Data Visualization Community Survey for 2020 has responses to 50+ questions and was taken by over 1,700 people. It covers professional data visualization details like salary and hourly compensation, tool use, location, audiences, organizational structure and more. 

The public data set has been abridged and anonymized to protect the privacy of respondents. Some fields from the survey are removed because they could have allowed for mosaic deanonymization. For example, we asked more detailed demographic and location characteristics than we have made publicly available. Languages spoken, city, and job title of the respondent are not included in the public dataset. The country of respondents was suppressed for those who were the only respondent in their city and country, as well as trans or non-binary respondents (because of their very small number among the respondents and the relatively small number in data visualization community as a whole). Years of professional experience and years of data visualization experience have been coarsened to categorical variables.

# About the survey

The survey was run September 1 to October 1, 2020. Respondents were asked a series of questions about their backgrounds, education, location, professional training, professional experience, state of data visualization, the people who make it, and where the practice is headed.

The survey was designed to be inclusive of different types of practitioners including those who work full time for organizations in primarily data visualization roles, freelancers, students, teachers and hobbyists. Respondents were given different sets of questions tailored to their roles depending on what type (or multiple types) of practitioner they identified as.
