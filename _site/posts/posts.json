Background Information\nFor this visualisation makeover, I have used data from Imperial College London YouGov Covid 19 Behaviour Tracker Data Hub. This data gathers global insights on people’s behaviours in response to COVID-19 covering 29 countries, in the form of survey questionnaire. In particular, this post is interested in exploring the willingness of the public on COVID-vaccination. In this blog, I will makeover visualisation on vaccine willingness done by one of the research scientists, by examining the following 3 survey questions in the context of different gender and employment status:\n1. If a Covid-19 vaccine were made available to me this week, I would definitely get it.\n2. I am worried about getting COVID19.\n3. I am worried about potential side effects of a COVID19 vaccine.\n2. Critiques and Suggestions\n\n\n\n2.1 Clarity\n\n\nSN\n\n\nCritique\n\n\nSuggestion\n\n\n1\n\n\nVisualisation on the left is intended to show “which country is more pro-vaccine”, by computing the percentage of each response and combining them into a percentage stacked bar chart. However, for each country, it’s not easy to see the proportion of pro-vaccine and compare it among different countries.\n\n\nSort countries by proportion of pro-vaccine responses in descending order.\n\n\n2\n\n\nMoreover, scaling each bar into the same height is not clear enough to compare the difference between pro-vaccine responses and anti-vaccine responses.\n\n\nPlace neutral responses at centre 0, negative value showing proportion of disagree responses and positive value showing proportion of agree responses.\n\n\n3\n\n\nIt’s hard to distinguish bars having the same length.\n\n\nAdd value label on each bar.\n\n\n4\n\n\nLegend is not very clear, i.e. what does 2, 3, 4 represent specifically?\n\n\nChange 2, 3, 4 to 2 – Agree, 3 – I don’t know, 4 – Disagree respectively.\n\n\n5\n\n\nVisualisation on the right is generally straightforward and clear. However, the simple percentage does not reflect statistical measures, how much you can expect your service results to reflect the view from the overall population. For example, if we have a high proportion of strongly agree responses with a wide margin of error, then this survey result is not very reliable.\n\n\nCalculate confidence interval for each value to get a more comprehensive view of the survey results.\n\n\n6\n\n\nMoreover, this visualisation is not convincing enough in a way that only high level view of the survey results is presented and insights from different angles are not revealed. For example, by examining deeper into gender level, males are generally more willing to get vaccinated than females respondents.\n\n\nExplore survey results from various perspectives, such as gender and employment status, and the relation between other survey questions.\n\n\n2.2 Aesthetics\n\n\nSN\n\n\nCritique\n\n\nSuggestion\n\n\n1\n\n\nIt’s redundant and distractive to use five different colours for each response in the left visualisation, making it hard to view the survey results. | Use the same colour for the same group (1.agree 2.neutral 3. disagree) with different hue level. For example, dark green for strongly agree, light green for agree.\n\n\nUse the same colour for the same group (1.agree 2.neutral 3. disagree) with different hue level. For example, dark green for strongly agree, light green for agree.\n\n\n2\n\n\nThe x-axis of two visualisations are not consistent, the first plot has no decimal place whereas the second plot has 2 decimal places.\n\n\nMake them consistent.\n\n\n3\n\n\nGenerally good axis marks in twenties and grid lines to facilitate easy readings, clear use of fonts, font sizes and layout with very straightforward titles.\n\n\nFollow and format to ensure so.\n\n\n3. Proposed Design\n3.1 Sketch\n\n3.2 Advantages of Proposed Design\nThe first visualisation:\n1. Clearly separating the pro-vaccine and anti-vaccine responses into postive and negative x-axis makes audiences easier to detect difference between two types of responses and difference between countries.\n2. Sorting rows according to % of pro-vaccine responses answers the question of “which country is more pro-vaccine” in a more clear way.\nThe second visualisation:\nUsing confidence interval gives audiences a better sense of how reliable is the result.  \nThe third visualisation:\nLooking into result of survey’s questions vac2.1(worry about getting COVID) and vac2.2(worry about potential side effect of vaccine) help audiences better understand the public willingness on Covid-19 vaccination and the potential reasons why the public agrees or disagrees to getting vaccinated.\nOther comments:\nBy applying tooltip, the fourth and fifth visualisation provide audiences with a more comprehensive understanding of the survey results on vaccine willingness at the country level. Similarly, being able to filter via gender and employment status gives insights on the different behaviours within each group.\n4. Data Visualisation Step-by-Step\n\n\n\n",

Critiques and Suggestions\n\n\n\n1.1 Clarity\n\n\nSN\n\n\nCritique\n\n\nSuggestion\n\n\n\n\nThere is no y-axis on the graph. Readers can only see the trend of resident labour force percentage by age group. When they want to know the approximate values for certain age groups, they need to look up the table at the bottom, which is not very clear and efficient.\n\n\nAdd y-axis and points for each age group on the graph to facilitate easy reading.\n\n\n\n\nThe purpose of this visualisation is not conveyed well enough by the title. This visualisation aims to compare the share of resident labour force of different age groups between 2009 and 2019. The title “resident labour force by age” is oversimplified.\n\n\nChange the title to “Share of Resident Labour Force by Age Group, 2009 vs 2019 (June)”.\n\n\n\n\nIt’s redundant to have the table at the bottom as it contains the same information as in the line chart. There is no need to have separate representation.\n\n\nMove the table information to the existing line chart, by adding text label for each point.\n\n\n\n\nIn the statement, it mentions the labour force participation rate (LFPR), however in this visualisation, there is no information or visualisation about LFPR.\n\n\nAdd a separate visualisation representing LFPR.\n\n\n\n\nIt’s not clear and easy to see how median age is derived based on this visualisation.\n\n\nAdd a separate visualisation to show how the median age of resident labour force is derived.\n\n\n1.2 Aesthetics\n\n\nSN\n\n\nCritique\n\n\nSuggestion\n\n\n\n\nSource and note don’t align, which makes this visualisation look messy at the bottom.\n\n\nSet both source and note to be left or central alignment.\n\n\n\n\nNot efficient use of space, with much white spaces in the top left and right segments. Legend on the line is good, but it’s a bit crowded at the bottom right corner. There are many text components in that area.\n\n\nOptimise use of space.\n\n\n\n\nThe grey and blue line colours are hard to distinguish.\n\n\nChange colour of the two lines.\n\n\n2. Proposed Design\n\n3. Data Visualisation Step-by-Step\n3.1 Data Preparation\n\n\nSN\n\n\nActions\n\n\nScreenshots\n\n\n\n\nTable 5 “Resident Labour Force Participation Rate by Age and Sex, 2009-2019 (June)” and Table 7 “Resident Labour Force Aged Fifteen Years and Over by Age and Sex, 2009-2019 (June)” are used for the visualisation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor table 5, only columns Age Group, 2009 and 2019, as well as rows 15-19, 20-24, 25-29, 30-34, 35-30, 40-44, 45-49, 50-54, 55-59, 60-64, 65-69 and 70&over are extracted. Similarly, the same data cleaning procedure was performed for table 7, as for table 5. Below is the final datasets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to find the median age of resident labour force, two charts for years 2009 and 2019 were plotted respectively, as shown below. In both years, the 50th percentile falls within age group 40-44. Therefore, a new sheet in table 7 called “Age and year” was created, and the 40-44 age group was split into five values (i.e. 40,41,42,43,44). The same number of resident labour force (i.e. aged 40-44 resident labour force / 5) was assigned to each age.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2 Tableau Works\n3.2.1 Import Data\n\n\nSN\n\n\nActions\n\n\nScreenshots\n\n\n\n\nImport excel worksheets and create an extract of the data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPivot the labour force participation rate data and rename the fields.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSN\nActions\nScreenshots\n1.\nImport excel worksheets and create an extract of the data.\n\n2.\nPivot the labour force participation rate data and rename the fields.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2.2 Visualisation 1\n\n\nSN\n\n\nActions\n\n\nScreenshots\n\n\n\n\nDrag Age Group under T7_T worksheet to Columns.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDrag Measure Names to Filters and only tick fields of 2009 and 2019.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelect Line option in the Marks panel on the left\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDrag Measure Values to Rows and Label, also drag Measure Names to Color.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the Measure Values section, apply Table Calculation (Percentage of Total) to both SUM(2009) and SUM(2019).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModify the title of y-axis (right click Edit Axis) and the number format of y-axis (right click Format -> Axis -> Numbers -> Percentage).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChange the name, title and colour of the legend (right click Edit Alias, Edit Title and Edit Colors).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModify the title of the worksheet.\n\n\n\n\nFinal Look of Visualisation 1\n\n3.2.3 Visualisation 2\n\n\nSN\n\n\nActions\n\n\nScreenshots\n\n\n\n\nDrag Age Group and Year under T5_T to Columns.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDrag LFPR under T5_T to Rows.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDrag Year to Color.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDray LFPR to Label.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHide Year’s header (right click Year -> untick Show Header).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChange the color of legend.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModify the title of the worksheet.\n\n\n\n\nFinal Look of Visualisation 2\n\n3.2.4 Visualisation 3\n\n\nSN\n\n\nActions\n\n\nScreenshots\n\n\n\n\nDrag 2009 under Age and year to Rows.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApply Quick Table Calculations (Percent of Total) on 2009.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDrag Year to Color.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDrag Age Group under Age and year to Label.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd reference line on the y-axis to point out median age at the 50th percentile (right click on the y-axis -> Add Reference Line -> Value: 0.5, Constant; Label: Custom, Median Age; Line, choose the second option).\n\n\n\n\nFinal Look of Visualisation 3\n\n3.2.5 Visualisation 4\n\n\nSN\n\n\nActions\n\n\nScreenshots\n\n\n\n\nPerform the same procedure as for visualisation 3, using data of 2019 under Age and year instead of 2009.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChange the color of bar.\n\n\n\n\nFinal Look of Visualisation 4\n\n3.2.6 Dashboard\n\n\nSN\n\n\nActions\n\n\nScreenshots\n\n\n\n\nCreate a dashboard to combine 4 visualisations and lay out accordingly.\n\n\n\n\n4. Final Data Visualisation Output\n\n5. Major Observations\nThe working population in Singapore is increasing, as for most age groups, labour force participation rate increased from 2009 to 2019. In particular, over 80% of residents aged between 25 and 54 are in the labour force.\nThe composition of resident labour forces in Singapore is changing. In comparison to 2009, share of resident labours aged between 15 and 54 decreased in 2019, whereas for labours aged over 55 years old, their shares in total working population increased in 2019. There are more older labours in the community. This phenomenon can be explained by the economic growth and more accessible health care facilities in Singapore.\nAs we can see from resident labour force’ age group distribution graph, the percentage of older labours increased dramatically from 2009 to 2019. Labours aged over 45 years old was around 40% of working population in 2009, but it’s approaching 50% in 2019. As a result, the median age of residents labours moved from 41 in 2009 to 44 in 2019.\n\n\n\n",
