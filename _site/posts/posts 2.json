Major Observations\n\nData Visualisation Link (Tableau Public) - https://public.tableau.com/profile/xinyue.bai#!/vizhome/ofStronglyAgree-gettingCOVID/DatavizMakeover2?publish=yes\n1. Background Information\nFor this visualisation makeover, I have used data from Imperial College London YouGov Covid 19 Behaviour Tracker Data Hub. This data gathers global insights on people’s behaviours in response to COVID-19 covering 29 countries, in the form of survey questionnaire. In particular, this post is interested in exploring the willingness of the public on COVID-vaccination. In this blog, I will makeover visualisation on vaccine willingness done by one of the research scientists, by examining the following 3 survey questions in the context of different gender and employment status:\n1. If a Covid-19 vaccine were made available to me this week, I would definitely get it.\n2. I am worried about getting COVID19.\n3. I am worried about potential side effects of a COVID19 vaccine.\n2. Critiques and Suggestions\n\n\n\nFigure 1: original visualisation\n\n\n\n2.1 Clarity\n\n\nSN\n\n\nCritique\n\n\nSuggestion\n\n\n1\n\n\nVisualisation on the left is intended to show “which country is more pro-vaccine”, by computing the percentage of each response and combining them into a percentage stacked bar chart. However, for each country, it’s not easy to see the proportion of pro-vaccine and compare it among different countries.\n\n\nSort countries by proportion of pro-vaccine responses in descending order.\n\n\n2\n\n\nMoreover, scaling each bar into the same height is not clear enough to compare the difference between pro-vaccine responses and anti-vaccine responses.\n\n\nPlace neutral responses at centre 0, negative value showing proportion of disagree responses and positive value showing proportion of agree responses.\n\n\n3\n\n\nIt’s hard to distinguish bars having the same length.\n\n\nAdd value label on each bar.\n\n\n4\n\n\nLegend is not very clear, i.e. what does 2, 3, 4 represent specifically?\n\n\nChange 2, 3, 4 to 2 – Agree, 3 – I don’t know, 4 – Disagree respectively.\n\n\n5\n\n\nVisualisation on the right is generally straightforward and clear. However, the simple percentage does not reflect statistical measures, how much you can expect your service results to reflect the view from the overall population. For example, if we have a high proportion of strongly agree responses with a wide margin of error, then this survey result is not very reliable.\n\n\nCalculate confidence interval for each value to get a more comprehensive view of the survey results.\n\n\n6\n\n\nMoreover, this visualisation is not convincing enough in a way that only high level view of the survey results is presented and insights from different angles are not revealed. For example, by examining deeper into gender level, males are generally more willing to get vaccinated than females respondents.\n\n\nExplore survey results from various perspectives, such as gender and employment status, and the relation between other survey questions.\n\n\n2.2 Aesthetics\n\n\nSN\n\n\nCritique\n\n\nSuggestion\n\n\n1\n\n\nIt’s redundant and distractive to use five different colours for each response in the left visualisation, making it hard to view the survey results. | Use the same colour for the same group (1.agree 2.neutral 3. disagree) with different hue level. For example, dark green for strongly agree, light green for agree.\n\n\nUse the same colour for the same group (1.agree 2.neutral 3. disagree) with different hue level. For example, dark green for strongly agree, light green for agree.\n\n\n2\n\n\nThe x-axis of two visualisations are not consistent, the first plot has no decimal place whereas the second plot has 2 decimal places.\n\n\nMake them consistent.\n\n\n3\n\n\nGenerally good axis marks in twenties and grid lines to facilitate easy readings, clear use of fonts, font sizes and layout with very straightforward titles.\n\n\nFollow and format to ensure so.\n\n\n3. Proposed Design\n3.1 Sketch\nFigure 2: sketch of proposed design3.2 Advantages of Proposed Design\nThe first visualisation:\n1. Clearly show which country is more pro-vaccine, by sorting rows according to % of pro-vaccine.\n2. Easier to detect difference between two types of responses and difference between countries, with postive and negative x-axis representing pro-vaccine and anti-vaccine responses respectively.\nThe second visualisation:\n- Clearly show how reliable the result is, by applying confidence interval.\nThe third visualisation:\n- Help audiences better understand the public willingness on Covid-19 vaccination and the potential reasons why the public agrees or disagrees to getting vaccinated, by looking into the result of survey’s questions vac2.1(worry about getting COVID) and vac2.2(worry about potential side effect of vaccine), and plotting their relation wtih trend lines.\nOther comments:\n- By applying tooltip, the fourth and fifth visualisation provide audiences with a more comprehensive understanding of the survey results on vaccine willingness at the country level. Similarly, being able to filter via gender and employment status gives insights on the different behaviours within each group.\n4. Data Visualisation Step-by-Step\n4.1 Data Preparation\nImport australia.csv, canada.csv, denmark.csv, finland.csv, france.csv, germany.csv, italy.csv, japan.csv, netherlands.csv, norway.csv, singapore.csv, south-korea.csv, sweden.csv, united-kingdom.csv files into tableau.  \nDouble click on New Union at the bottom left of Files and drag all csv files into Specific. \nClick on the triangle button on the top right and custom split variable vac_1 to obtain the score value for each response category (e.g. 1 - Strongly agree -> 1). \nEdit aliases for new column created (i.e. vac_1 - Split 1), 1 -> 1 - Strongly, 2 -> 2 - Agree, 3 -> 3 - I don’t know, 4 -> 4 - Disagree, 5 -> 5 - Strongly disagree. \nRename new column as vac1_score.\nClick on “=Abc” symbol and change its data type to Number(whole). \nRename Table Name as Country.\n4.2 Creating Visualisation\n4.2.1 Visualisation 1\nOpen a new worksheet.\nClick on Analysis -> Create Calculated Field.\nCreate 7 calculated fields as follow:\nNumber of Records - Vac1\nTotal Records - Vac1\nCount Negative\nTotal Count Negative\nPercentage - Vac1\nGantt Start\nGantt Percentage\n\nDrag Country to Rows, Grantt Percentage to Columns, vac1_score to Detail and Color\nGantt Percentage, click on the triangle button -> Compute Using -> vac1_score\nOn the legend panel, right click on Null, exclude null records.\nOn the Marks panel, right click on the triangle button of vac1_score (either color or detail), manually sort the vac1_score, in a order of strongly disagree -> disagree -> I don’t know -> agree -> strongly agree.\n\n\nBefore sort: \nAfter sort: \nChange chart type from Automatic to Gantt Bar\nDrag Percentage - Vac1 to Size and Label.\nAdjust label’s alignment.\nChange label’s format from Automatic to Percentage.\n\n\nSimilarly, right click on the x-axis and choose format, change axis’s value format to Percentage and add tick marks.\n\nAdd tick marks: \nChange color of the gantt bar. What it displays here is already the color I wanted. Red color represents anti-vaccine responses and green color represents pro-vaccine responses. Also, darker color implies more extreme responses (e.g. strongly agree and strongly disagree).\nSort Country by % of pro-vaccine responses.\nRight click on x-axis Edit Axis, change x-axis’s range to -100% to 100% and change its title to % of Total.\n\n\nDrag gender and employment_status to Filters.\n\n\nAdd pro-vaccine and anti-vaccine annotation on the chart for better clarity.\nRight click on the pane and create an annotation box for pro-vaccine.\nRight click on the box and select format to change the background color.  \nApply the same procedure for anti-vaccine annotation. Final look:   \n4.2.2 Visualisation 2\nOpen a new worksheet.\nCreate 11 calculated fields as follow:Number of Strongly Agree - Vac1\nProp of strongly agree - vac1\nZ_95%\nZ_99%\nProp-Standard Error\nProp_Margin of Error 95%\nProp_Margin of Error 99%\nProp_Confidence Interval 95%\nProp_Confidence Interval 99%\n\nDrag Country to Rows and Prop of strongly agree - vac1 to Columns\nDrag Measure Values to the top of x-axis.   \nIn the Filters panel, click on Measure Names -> Edit Filter -> select 95% and 99% upper and lower limits.\n\n\nChange 95% and 99% confidence interval representation to Line, click on the path and choose the last Line Type.\n\n\nDrag Measure Names to path under Measure Values section.\nClick on Measure Names (Detail) under Measure Values section and Prop of strongly agree - vac1 section, change it to Color.\n\nChange columns order, put Measure Values before Prop of strongly agree - vac1 and right click on the top x-axis -> synchronize axis.  \n\n\nChange the Measure Names’ order in the color legend, by adjusting in the Measure Values section.\n\n\nHide the top x-axis, by unticking Show Header.\nSort rows according to % of strongly agree.\nChange the color for 95% and 99% confidence interval according to your own preference, change axis’s number format and add tick marks. Detailed procedures are described in the visualisation 1.\n4.2.3 Visualisation 3\nOpen a new worksheet.\nCreate 8 calculated fields as follow:\nDetailed formulation can refer to visualisation 1, using Vac2.1 and Vac2.2 instead:\nNumber of Records - Vac2.1, Number of Records - Vac2.2\nTotal Records - Vac2.1, Total Records - Vac2.2\n\nDetailed formulation can refer to visualisation 2, using Vac2.1 and Vac2.2 instead.\nNumber of Strongly agree - Vac2.1, Number of Strongly agree - Vac2.2\nProp of strongly agree - vac2.1, Prop of strongly agree - vac2.2\n\nDrag Prop of strongly agree - vac1 to Columns, Prop of strongly agree - vac2.1 and Prop of strongly agree - vac2.2 to Rows, also drag Country to Detail under All section.\nDrag Measure Names to Filters and only tick Prop of strongly agree - vac2.1 and Prop of strongly agree - vac2.2.\nDrag Measure Names to Color under All section.\nRight click on the pane to add two trendlines.\nDrag Country to Label and highlist points wiht minimum % of strongly agree 2.1/2.2 and maximum % of strongly agree 2.1/2.2.\n\nChange axis’s number format and add tick marks. Detailed procedures are described in the visualisation 1.\n4.2.4 Visualisation 4\nOpen a new worksheet.\nDrag Country to Rows and Prop of strongly agree - vac2.1 to Columns, drag another Prop of strongly agree - vac2.1 to the top of x-axis and synchronize axis.\nChange one of the variable representation to Bar.\nAdjust size and color of Bar and Circle.\nDrag Country to Label under Prop of strongly agree - vac2.1 (Circle) section and click on Label to just its Alignment.\nChange the label format to Percentage.\n\nSort rows according to % of strongly agree - vac2.1, change axis’s number format and range, add tick marks. Detailed procedures are described in the visualisation 1.\nFinal look of visualisation 4.   \n4.2.5 Visualisation 5\nSame procedure as visualisation 4, except using Prop of strongly agree - vac2.2 instead of Prop of strongly agree - vac2.1.\n4.2.6 Visualisation 6\nOpen a new worksheet.\nDrag employment_status to Columns, and two vac1_score to Rows, modify both of them to measure Count.\nRight click on the bottom y axis to make the plot into dual axis.\nExclude Null employment status.\nChange one of the vac1_score representation to Line.\nDrag vac1_score to Label under the circle representation and modify it into count.\nApply Quick Table Calculation - Percent of Total to all three CNT(vac1_score).\nKeep only one y-axis, change the name of y-axis.

Major Observations\n 1. UK respondents showed the highest willingess to get vaccinated, regardless of female or male. This is consistent with the result of question Vac2.2 with respect to potential side effect. As shown in the relationship chart, UK respondents are also least worried about the side effect of COVID vaccine.\n2. Males are generally more pro-vaccine than Females. 3. Japan’s result is very interesting. Japanese respondents show low willingess in getting vaccine overall, but they also express the highest worries of getting COVID compared to other countries. 38% of Japanese respondents worry about getting COVID whereas less than 38%, 35% of respondents worry about the potential side effects of COVID vaccine, implying getting COVID is more of their concern. 4. The survey results is overall reliable, with a narrow confidence interval for all countries. Netherlands has a relatively larger CI range, but it’s acceptable.\n\n\n\nBy looking into the results of more developed economies in Asia, Japan, Singapore and South korea, we can see that full-time employed respondents are more willing to get vaccination in all three countries, compared to other employment status.\nFrench respondents show the least interest in getting vaccinated, which could possibly be explained by the fear of potential side effect of COVID vaccine as almost half of respondents(44%) strongly worry about the side effect.\n\n\n\n",

    "contents": "\n1.0 Overview\nCorrelation coefficient is a popular statistic that use to measure the type and strength of the relationship between two variables. The values of a correlation coefficient ranges between -1.0 and 1.0. A correlation coefficient of 1 shows a perfect linear relationship between the two variables, while a -1.0 shows a perfect inverse relationship between the two variables. A correlation coeficient of 0.0 shows no linear relationship between the two variables.\nWhen multivariate data are used, the correlation coeficeints of the pair comparisons are displayed in a table form known as correlation matrix or scatterplot matrix.\nThere are three broad reasons for computing a correlation matrix.\nTo reveal the relationship between highdimensional variables pairwisely.\nTo input into other analyses. For example, people commonly use correlation matrixes as inputs for exploratory factor analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, structural equation models, and linear regression when excluding missing values pairwise.\nAs a diagnostic when checking other analyses. For example, with linear regression a high amount of correlations suggests that the linear regression’s estimates will be unreliable.\nWhen the data is large, both in terms of the number of observations and the number of variables, Corrgram tend to be used to visually explore and analyse the structure and the patterns of relations among variables. It is designed based on two main schemes:\nRendering the value of a correlation to depict its sign and magnitude, and\nReordering the variables in a correlation matrix so that “similar” variables are positioned adjacently, facilitating perception.\nIn this hands-on exercise, you will learn how to plot data visualisation for visualising correlation matrix with R. It consists of three main sections. First, you will learn how to create correlation matrix using pairs() of R Graphics. Next, you will learn how to plot corrgram using corrplot package of R Lastly, you will learn how to create an interactive correlation matrix using plotly R. .\n2.0 Installing and Launching R Packages\nBefore you get started, you are required:\nto start a new R project, and\nto create a new R Markdown document.\nNext, you will use the code chunk below to install and launch corrplot, ggpubr, plotly and tidyverse in RStudio.\n\n\npackages = c('ggpubr', 'tidyverse')\n\nfor(p in packages){library\n  if(!require(p, character.only = T)){\n    install.packages(p)\n  }\n  library(p, character.only = T)\n}\n\n\n\n3.0 Importing and Preparing The Data Set\nIn this hands-on exercise, the Wine Quality Data Set of UCI Machine Learning Repository will be used. The data set consists of 13 variables and 6497 observations. For the purpose of this exercise, we have combined the red wine and white wine data into one data file. It is called wine_quality and is in csv file format.\n3.1 Importing Data\nFirst, let us import the data into R by using read_csv() of readr package.\n\n\nwine <- read_csv(\"data/wine_quality.csv\")\n\n\n\nNotice that beside quality and type, the rest of the variables are numerical and continuous data type.\n4.0 Univariate EDA with Histogram\nIn the figure below, multiple histograms are plottted to reveal the distribution of the selected variables in the wine quality data sets.\n\n\n\nThe code chunks used to create the data visualisation consists of two main parts. First, we will create the individual histograms using the code chunk below.\n\n\nfa <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= `fixed acidity`)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\nva <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= `volatile acidity`)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\nca <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= `citric acid`)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\nrs <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= `residual sugar`)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\nch <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= `chlorides`)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\nfSO2 <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= `free sulfur dioxide`)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\ntSO2 <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= `total sulfur dioxide`)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\ndensity <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= density)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\npH <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= pH)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\nsulphates <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= sulphates)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\nalcohol <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= alcohol)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\n\n\n\nNext, the ggarrange function of ggpur package is used to group these histograms together.\n\n\nggarrange(fa, va, ca, rs, ch, fSO2, tSO2, density, pH, sulphates, alcohol, \n          ncol = 4, nrow = 3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
